Ant colony systems optimization applied to BNF grammars rule derivation (ACORD Algorithm)

> Ant Colony Systems have been widely employed in optimization issues primarily focused on path finding optimization, such as Travelling Salesman Problem. The main advantage lies in the choice of the edge to be explored, defined using pheromone trails. This article proposes the use of Ant Colony Systems to explore a Backus-Naur form grammar whose elements are solutions to a given problem. Similar models, without using Ant Colonies, have been used to solve optimization problems or to automatically generate programs such as Grammatical Swarm (based on Particle Swarm Optimization) and Gramatical Evolution (based on Genetic Algorithms). Proposed algorithm opens the way to a new branch of research in Swarm Intelligence, which until now has been almost non-existent, using ant colony algorithms to generate solutions of a given problem described by a BNF grammar with the advantage of genotype-phenotype mapping, described in Grammatical Evolution. In this case, such mapping is performed based on the pheromone concentration for each rule.
